js tools
========

A quick test of the awesome new tools for front-end development. Learning is the goal, so the plan is this:

 * Exactly one commit for each tool added to the project. If the change requires multiple steps, branch, make the minimum number of commits necessary, and merge with `--no-ff` so that it is easy to identify as one step in the history.

 * Add the minimum configuration and changes to make it work nicely with what is already here.

 * Write a detailed commit message explaining anything notable about the required changes. Please include links to external resources.

 * Expand on notable but context-specific changes by adding a comment to the affected lines on github.


When everything is together, the repository should act as a solid reference for the set-up of the chosen tools.
